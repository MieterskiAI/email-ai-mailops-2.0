# AI MailOps 2.0 – Decision-Support System for Operational Email Triage

Designing human-centered workflows that help operational teams regain control over chaotic inboxes.

## 🧠 Business Context

In many organizations, shared inboxes are a hidden bottleneck in operational processes.  
Important cases get lost, priorities are unclear and decisions are made chaotically.

This project is not about replacing people with automation.

It is about designing a decision-support workflow that helps employees:
- understand the intent of each message,
- see what really matters,
- and decide what to do next.

## 🔁 Before / After

**Before**
- no prioritization  
- manual inbox triage  
- high risk of missing critical cases  

**After**
- structured decision flow  
- AI-supported action suggestions  
- faster reaction time of operational teams  

## 🔄 Decision Flow

Incoming Email  
→ AI Intent Analysis  
→ Suggested Decision  
→ Human Action

## 🤝 Human-in-the-Loop

This system never sends or executes decisions automatically.  
AI suggests actions, but final responsibility always belongs to the employee.

## How the Pipeline Works

**1. Gmail Trigger – New Email Arrives**  
Zapier captures incoming email metadata + body.

**2. AI Classification (OpenAI GPT)**  
Model assigns:
- Type: Lead / Support / Question / Urgent / Spam  
- Priority: 1–10  
- Summary: clean, short description  

**3. Data Cleanup (Formatter Steps)**  
Extracted components for Sheets & Gmail:
- Timestamp  
- Sender  
- Subject  
- Classification  
- Priority  
- Summary  

**4. Log to Google Sheets**  
System saves every message to `MailOps_Log` sheet.

**5. AI Draft Reply (OpenAI GPT)**  
AI generates a short, helpful reply:
- No greeting  
- No signature  
- No invented facts  

**6. Gmail Draft Creation**  
Google Draft is created and ready for final approval / sending.
