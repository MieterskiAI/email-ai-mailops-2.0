# AI MailOps 2.0

Intelligent Email Automation System  
Automated end-to-end pipeline for processing inbound emails using Zapier + OpenAI.

System automatically:
- classifies messages (Lead / Support / Question / Spam / Urgent),
- assigns priority (1–10),
- generates a clean summary,
- logs everything to Google Sheets,
- and creates a ready-to-send **email draft in Gmail**.

### 2. AI Classification (OpenAI GPT)
Model assigns:
- **Type:** Lead / Support / Question / Urgent / Spam  
- **Priority:** 1–10  
- **Summary:** clean, short description

### 3. Data Cleanup (Formatter Steps)
Extracted components for Sheets & Gmail:
- Timestamp  
- Sender  
- Subject

### 4. Log to Google Sheets
System saves every message to `MailOps_Log` sheet.

AI generates a short, helpful reply:
- No greeting  
- No signature  
- No invented facts  

### 6. Gmail Draft Creation
Google Draft is created and ready for final approval / sending.
